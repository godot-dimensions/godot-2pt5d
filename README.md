# Godot 2.5D

Node25D and other 2.5-dimensional types for making 2.5D games in Godot.

## Installation

First, have all the Godot dependencies installed on your computer as per the
[official instructions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/index.html).

If you want all of the Godot Dimensions modules at once, you can grab a
branch of [our Godot fork](https://github.com/godot-dimensions/godot/tree/dimensions-latest).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/godot-dimensions/godot godot-dimensions
cd godot-dimensions
# First, make sure you can compile regular Godot.
scons
# Then, switch to the dimensions branch and download the submodules.
git switch dimensions-latest
git submodule update --init --recursive
scons
# Re-run the `scons` command to re-compile if you make changes.
```

Alternatively, if you only want 2.5D, you can start with any clone
of Godot Engine and add this module to it:

```shell
cd modules
git clone https://github.com/godot-dimensions/godot-2pt5d 2pt5d
# Make sure the folder is named `2pt5d`, not `godot-2pt5d`!
cd ..
scons
# Re-run the `scons` command to re-compile if you make changes.
```

It should now be successfully compiled, and you can run the executable in the `bin` folder.
