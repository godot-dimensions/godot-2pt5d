		Context for converting 3D coordinates into 2D for rendering in the 2D canvas.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		World25D provides a 2.5-dimensional basis that converts 3D coordinates into 2D coordinates for rendering in the 2D canvas. It is used by [Node25D] and its subclasses, usually only one per scene.
		The basis is a 2-row 3-column matrix of three [Vector2] values, plus a [Vector3] row at the bottom for the draw order. This is packed into a [Basis] for serializing and exposing via [Variant], but there are also individual [Vector2] members for each column of the basis. However, instead of setting the basis manually, you may wish to use one of the presets, which will set the basis to a predefined value, or a class of values calculated from the angle properties.
		[b]Note:[/b] If you are looking for the other type of 2.5D, with 3D graphics but 2D transforms, simply use [Node3D] instead and lock the Z axis to zero. That type does not require a new class to accomplish.

			<description>
				Transforms a 3D transform into a 2D transform for rendering in the 2D canvas. The 2D transform's Y axis will be parallel and flipped compared to the 3D transform's Y axis, and the X axis will be perpendicular to that, such that the transform is conformal (orthogonal and uniform scale) and has no flip. If [param normalized] is [code]true[/code], the 2D transform will have a scale of [code]1.0[/code] (default).

			<return type="Vector3" />
			<param index="0" name="vector2" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Inverse-transforms a 2D position into a 3D position. This is locked to a plane that intersects the origin, and is not a full inverse transform, however it is useful as an intermediate step for some transform operations.
