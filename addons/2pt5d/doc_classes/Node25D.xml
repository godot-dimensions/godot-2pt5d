		2.5-dimensional node, inherited by all 2.5D nodes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Node25D is the base class for all 2.5-dimensional nodes. For the purposes of this class, "2.5D" refers to objects that have transform math done in 3D space, including a 3D position, but are rendered in 2D as a [CanvasItem].
		[b]Note:[/b] If you are looking for the other type of 2.5D, with 3D graphics but 2D transforms, simply use [Node3D] instead and lock the Z axis to zero. That type does not require a new node class to accomplish.

			The [World25D] context in which the node exists. It contains a 2.5D basis for converting 3D coordinates into 2D coordinates for rendering in the 2D canvas.
